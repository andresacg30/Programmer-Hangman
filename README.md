# Programmer-Hangman
This is a short version of the hangman game. Read the README for more info.

It has a few programming languages as options for guessing.
The program will choose the option randomly, and will ask you if you want to play or exit.
You have 8 lives to guess the word.
Once you're playing, it will show you the length of the word and ask you to start guessing word by word.
If your input is not a lowercase English letter, it will trow you an error.
If your letter is not in the word, you will lose a live.
Game is finished when you guess the word or you lost all lives!
